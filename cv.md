## Code example:

Write Number in Expanded Form
You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form.
For example:
expandedForm(70304); // Should return ‘70000 + 300 + 4’

```
 function expandedForm(num) {

  return String(num)

    .split("")

    .map( (el, index) => el + '0'.repeat(String(num).length - index - 1))

    .filter(Number)

    .join(" + ");

}
```
